# DirSFTP

## DirSFTP (say "dear ess eff tea pea") is a cross-platform, open-source SFTP client (file browser) that focuses on simplicity 

### _Built on .NET MAUI Blazor using C#_

Ever wanted to browse your SFTP file server from your phone? Yeah, me neither... But on very rare occasions it does happen, and when it happens, you notice that there is no WinSCP for Android and that most SFTP clients are either proprietary (closed-source), or have a very bad GUI.

This right here is GPL-3.0 licensed, fully open-source and developed with simplicity in mind.

DirSFTP allows you to:

- Connect to one or more SFTP servers
- Verify host key fingerprint before connecting
- Authenticating using traditional username + password, or also SSH keys
- Create directories
- Delete directories
- Upload files
- Download files
- Rename items
- chmod

All of the above functionality of course depends on whatever permission you may or may not have on the server side for the logged in user.
